# RASM
 Rasm is a simple interpreted programming language made in rust.

 Rasm is meant to a be a combination of the (somewhat) simplicity of C and the 3-4 letter commands of ASM

# Docs
 I made docs in the `docs` folder with a bunch of files that will hopefully help you learn rasm!

 The docs probably suck because I don't like making docs so I don't put much effort.
