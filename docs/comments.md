# Comments
 To make a comment you start a line with //

 If the comment has no code after it besides HALT it needs a semicolon.

 I don't know why its like that but I probably won't fix it.

 An example of comments:

 ```
 // This is a comment and it doesnt need a semicolon!
 out "hello!";

 // This one does need a semicolon for some reason!;
 HALT
 ```
