# Compare
 Compare is pretty much the RASM version of if!

 It works differently than other langs!

 Syntax:
 ```
 cmp var value length;
 ```

 Length is how many lines of code after the cmp statement will only be ran if var and value are the same.

 Example:
 ```
 int var 2;

 cmp var 2 1;
 out "Var is 2!";
 ```

 If var is 2 then it will print "Var is 2!" but if it isnt it will do nothing.
