# Out
 Out is the keyword for printing a string.

 Currently there is no way to print an actual int besides making an int var and printing it.

 You can print an int stored as a string with this though.

 To print a string:

 ```
 out "Hello World!";
 ```

 There is the `outv` keyword for printing variables!

 To print a variable:

 ```
 outv var;
 ```
