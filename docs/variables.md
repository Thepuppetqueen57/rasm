# Variables
 To make a variable there are currently 2 keywords.

 `str` and `int`

 I don't think I have to explain the difference between those keywords.

 The syntax for making a variable goes as follows:

 ```
 str name "value"
 int name2 6
 ```

 To print a variable you use the `outv` keyword.

 More about that is explained in `out.md`
